# About generation of web
## web 1.0
The first iteration of the web represents the web 1.0, which, according to Berners-Lee, is the “read-only web.” In other words, the early web allowed us to search for information and read it.
## web 2.0
We are now seeing the infancy of web 2.0, or the “read-write” web as Berners-Lee described it. It’s the ability to contribute content and interact with other web users. It has dramatically changed the landscape of the web in a short time. It has much potential. As examples, look at YouTube and MySpace, which rely on user submissions. Web 2.0 is a welcome response to web users, who want to participate in the information.

## web 3.0
This leads us web 3.0 (extending the vague nomenclature). By extrapolating Tim Berners-Lee’s explanations, web 3.0 is “read-write-execute.” This is difficult to envision in its abstract form. To illustrate, consider semantic markup and web services.

# Static Websites
Static website contents is the fixed pages content. each pagee in code in HTML display the same information to every visitors.

# Dynamic websites
Dynamic websites server-side scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP, or ASP. When a user accesses a dynamic website, the site can be changed through code that is run in the browser and on the server. The end result is the same as that on a static website: an HTML page displayed on the web browser.
