# About generation of web
## web 1.0
The first iteration of the web represents the web 1.0, which, according to Berners-Lee, is the “read-only web.” In other words, the early web allowed us to search for information and read it.
## web 2.0
We are now seeing the infancy of web 2.0, or the “read-write” web as Berners-Lee described it. It’s the ability to contribute content and interact with other web users. It has dramatically changed the landscape of the web in a short time. It has much potential. As examples, look at YouTube and MySpace, which rely on user submissions. Web 2.0 is a welcome response to web users, who want to participate in the information.

## web 3.0
This leads us web 3.0 (extending the vague nomenclature). By extrapolating Tim Berners-Lee’s explanations, web 3.0 is “read-write-execute.” This is difficult to envision in its abstract form. To illustrate, consider semantic markup and web services.

# Static Websites
Static website contents is the fixed pages content. each pagee in code in HTML display the same information to every visitors.

# Dynamic websites
Dynamic websites server-side scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP, or ASP. When a user accesses a dynamic website, the site can be changed through code that is run in the browser and on the server. The end result is the same as that on a static website: an HTML page displayed on the web browser.

# Architecture of static and dynamic websites
Static website contents is the fixed pages content. each pagee in code in HTML display the same information to every visitors. means static website fast than dynamic websites.


Dynamic websites server-side scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP, or ASP. When a user accesses a dynamic website, the site can be changed through code that is run in the browser and on the server. it is very loaded files compaire on static websites.

## Phishing

 Masquerading as a trustworthy person or business, phishers attempt to steal sensitive financial or personal information through fraudulent email or instant messages.
